# CS330_GraphicsDesign
Welcome to my repository, I will answer the following Questions from Module Eight Journal

1. How do I approach designing software?
I do not approach software that often but when I do, I make sure to use one of the Software Developement Approaches so that I or my team have an understanding of what is needed to complete and produce a quality product.

> What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new design skills that helped me the most is the use of Microsoft Visual Studio

> What design process did you follow for your project work?
Once the project was identified, the next step is to define the scope and objectives of the project. This involved setting goals, defining the criteria, and outlining the project timeline.

> How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I thing that after the final product is completed, it is important to improve the design based on feedback.. Improvements to the design can ensure that it continues to meet the needs of users and the business stakeholders.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
I haven't really developed any programs at this time. I still have to complete other courses to get an understanding or opportunity to do that.

> What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The new development strategies that I used in my 3D scene was the use of URender to help my bring my 3D design to life. It also helped me when I applied texture to the object.

> How did iteration factor into your development?
It factored on how to pace and when to implement into the design.

> How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I started from trying to implement a 2D pyramid into 3D diamond shape floating about the ground. The code seem to get more complicated but with help of the professor I was able to implement the code without error

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help by opening up or introduce me to the foundations of hardware and software of computers and programs. It will definitely help by letting employers know that I have an understanding in Information Technology.

> How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Honestly, it may not have any true impact on my educational pathway because it's not my major. I interested in personal reasons now because of this course. It gave a deep appreciation of those who's job it is in developing computer graphics.

> How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I work for a software program for the DoD, graphics design is not part of this program. I think if I was to use graphics and visualization for the job it could impact some decisions that goes into funding the program. It'll be used in some the training videos we use to showcase to the stakeholders.
